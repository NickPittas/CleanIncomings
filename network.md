1. Blazing-fast filename scans (no content indexing)

    os.scandir / pathlib
    – Since Python 3.5, os.scandir() (and by extension pathlib.Path.rglob) uses the same underlying C APIs as find/dirent, and can be 5–10× faster than naïve os.walk loops.
    – Wrap scans in a thread- or process-pool (concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor) to pop‐off parallel directory reads.

    aiopath + aiofiles
    – If your network filesystem supports async I/O (e.g. SMB3 with kernel support), you can fire off many concurrent list‐calls with aiofiles+aiopath.
    – Still keeps the heavy lifting in kernel/FS client.

    Calling native tools via subprocess
    – Let the OS’s find, fd (Rust), or locate handle the directory traversal; pipe results back into Python for filtering or aggregation:

    import subprocess
    proc = subprocess.Popen(
        ["fd", "--threads", "0", search_pattern, root_dir],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE
    )
    for line in proc.stdout:
        handle_match(line.decode().rstrip())

2. Full-text or metadata-driven search via embedded index

    Xapian with python-xapian
    – C++ core → binding in Python. Scales to tens of millions of documents, supports ranking, boolean queries, phrase search, pluggable stemmers.
    – Index time is heavy, but queries return in milliseconds.

    Whoosh (pure-Python)
    – Easy install, pure-Python indexing/search library.
    – Good for small–medium corpora (up to a few million docs).
    – If you need in-process and Python-only, it’s the simplest—but you’ll trade some raw speed.

    SQLite FTS5
    – Built into Python’s sqlite3 module.
    – Create a virtual table over your file metadata or extracted text and use MATCH queries.
    – Reasonably fast for moderate datasets; no extra dependencies.

3. Distributed / server-based search

If you’ve got a cluster or want true remote indexing:

    Elasticsearch + elasticsearch-py
    – Industry standard RESTful search engine.
    – Shardable, fault-tolerant, near-real-time.
    – Python client is mature and supports bulk indexing, scroll APIs, aggregations.

    Apache Solr + pysolr
    – Solr is Lucene under the hood, JVM-based.
    – pysolr is a thin Python wrapper for update/query.
    – Great if you’re already in a Java ecosystem.

4. Practical “how to choose” and network tips

    Don’t reinvent the wheel: for raw filename scans, your fastest path is usually fd or find called via subprocess. Python’s role is orchestration, not the I/O engine.

    Index once, query often: if content search is your goal, build an index (Xapian, Elasticsearch) on a beefy server that has local SSDs, then query over 10 GbE.

    Parallelize at the FS level: user-land threading helps, but make sure your network FS supports multiple concurrent opens and reads without bottlenecking at a single RPC.

    Profile early: use Python’s cProfile or simple timers around your I/O loops to know whether you’re CPU-bound (spammy regex) or I/O-bound (waiting on the network/drive).
