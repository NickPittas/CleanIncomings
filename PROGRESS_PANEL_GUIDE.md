# Multi-Stage Progress Panel Guide

## Overview

The Clean Incomings application now features a beautiful multi-stage progress panel that provides detailed visual feedback during scanning operations. This replaces the simple progress bar with a comprehensive display showing each phase of the operation.

## Features

### Visual Elements
- **Stage Icons**: Each stage shows appropriate icons (â—‹ pending, ðŸ”„ in progress, âœ“ completed, âœ— error)
- **Color-coded Status**: Icons and text change color based on stage status (gray, blue, green, red)
- **Individual Progress Bars**: Each stage has its own progress bar showing completion
- **Detail Information**: Real-time details like file counts, current operations, etc.
- **Overall Progress**: Master progress bar showing overall completion

### Stages

The progress panel tracks these stages during a scan operation:

1. **Validation** - Checking folders and settings
2. **Scanning Files** - Discovering files and folders in the source directory
3. **Generating Mappings** - Creating normalization proposals based on the selected profile
4. **Processing Results** - Preparing data for display in the GUI
5. **Complete** - All operations finished successfully

## Usage

### Testing the Progress Panel

Run the test script to see the progress panel in action:

```bash
python test_progress_panel.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Complete scan simulation with realistic timing
- Error handling and display
- Stage transitions with visual feedback
- Progress updates with file counts
- Auto-hide functionality after completion

### Integration in Main App

When you press the "Refresh/Scan" button, you'll now see:

1. **Validation Stage** - Quick check of inputs (folders, profiles)
2. **Scanning Stage** - Real-time file discovery with counts and current file names
3. **Mapping Stage** - Mapping generation with progress and file processing counts
4. **Processing Stage** - Final data transformation
5. **Complete Stage** - Success confirmation

### Error Handling

If any stage fails:
- The failed stage shows a red âœ— icon
- Error details are displayed in the stage details
- The overall progress stops at the failed stage
- You can see exactly where the problem occurred

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Clear Visibility**: See exactly what's happening during long operations
- **Time Awareness**: Understand how much work remains
- **Error Context**: Know exactly what failed and why
- **Professional Feel**: Modern, polished interface

### For Developers
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for progress updates
- **Thread-Safe**: All GUI updates properly scheduled
- **Modular**: Each stage independent and customizable
- **Maintainable**: Centralized progress logic

## Technical Implementation

The system consists of:

1. **ProgressPanel** (`python/gui_components/progress_panel.py`) - Main progress display component
2. **StatusManager** - Enhanced to handle multi-stage progress
3. **ScanManager** - Updated to trigger progress stages
4. **WidgetFactory** - Integrated progress panel into main layout

### Key Methods

```python
# Start scan with progress
status_manager.start_scan_progress()

# Complete validation
status_manager.complete_validation_stage()

# Finish scan (success/error)
status_manager.finish_scan_progress(success=True)
status_manager.finish_scan_progress(success=False, error_message="Error details")
```

## Aesthetic Design

The progress panel features:

- **Clean Layout**: Well-spaced elements with proper padding
- **Consistent Theming**: Matches app's light/dark mode and color themes
- **Smooth Updates**: Progress bars update smoothly without flickering
- **Readable Text**: Clear fonts and appropriate text sizes
- **Color Psychology**: Green for success, red for errors, blue for active
- **Professional Icons**: Unicode symbols that work across platforms

## Future Enhancements

The modular design allows for easy future improvements:

- Cancellation buttons for long operations
- Detailed progress for individual file operations
- Better time estimation algorithms
- Progress history and logging
- Nested progress for complex operations
