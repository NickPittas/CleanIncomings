Based on the current state of the PyQt5 conversion and the coding standards you've provided, here's what's left to complete:

Critical Issues to Fix First
1. Syntax Errors in Current Files

# Fixed widget_factory_pyqt5.py - line 269 has incomplete method
def add_tree_item(self, tree_widget, values, parent=None):
    """Add an item to a tree widget."""
    if parent is None:
        item = QTreeWidgetItem(tree_widget)
    else:
        item = QTreeWidgetItem(parent)
    item.setText(0, str(values.get("name", "")))
    item.setText(1, str(values.get("status", "")))
    item.setText(2, str(values.get("path", "")))
    item.setText(3, str(values.get("type", "")))
    item.setText(4, str(values.get("size", "")))
    item.setText(5, str(values.get("date_modified", "")))
    return item

2. Complete Missing PyQt5 Components
Following the <300 lines per component rule:

Settings Window (settings_window_pyqt5.py) - Functionality implemented
JSON Pattern Editor (pattern_editor_pyqt5.py) - Created
Profile Editor (profile_editor_pyqt5.py) - Created
Progress Panels (progress_panel_pyqt5.py) - Created
VLC Player Window (vlc_player_pyqt5.py) - Created
3. File Size Compliance Issues
Several files exceed the 500-line limit:

# Need to check and split these files:
app_gui_pyqt5.py          # Likely >500 lines
widget_factory_pyqt5.py   # May exceed limit with all additions

4. Missing Modular Panel System
The current UI lacks the resizable, modular panels you mentioned:

Tree panels need proper splitter management
Settings panels need tabbed organization
All panels need DPI-aware sizing
Implementation Plan (Following TDD Approach)
Phase 1: Fix Current Syntax Errors (Immediate)
# 1. Complete widget_factory_pyqt5.py methods
# 2. Fix any import/syntax issues in app_gui_pyqt5.py
# 3. Test basic application launch
Phase 2: Create Missing Core Components (<100 lines each)
# Following Single Responsibility Principle:

# settings_window_pyqt5.py - Main settings dialog
# pattern_editor_pyqt5.py - JSON pattern editing
# profile_editor_pyqt5.py - Profile management  
# progress_panel_pyqt5.py - Progress tracking UI
# vlc_player_pyqt5.py - Media player integration
Phase 3: Implement Modular Panel System
# panel_manager_pyqt5.py - Manages resizable panels
# splitter_layout_pyqt5.py - Handle panel splitting/docking
# dpi_manager_pyqt5.py - HiDPI scaling management
Phase 4: Complete Testing Coverage (>90%)
# tests/test_widget_factory.py
# tests/test_settings_window.py
# tests/test_panel_management.py
# tests/test_dpi_scaling.py

Specific Technical Debt
1. Code Quality Issues
Missing docstrings in several methods
Some functions exceed recommended length
Import organization needs cleanup
2. Configuration Compliance
Need to verify all regex patterns are in config files
JSON schemas for UI state need definition
Settings persistence needs proper validation
3. Accessibility Missing
No ARIA labels on interactive elements
Missing keyboard navigation
No tooltips or help text
Next Immediate Steps
Would you like me to:

Fix the syntax errors first (widget_factory_pyqt5.py completion)
Split oversized files to comply with 500-line rule
Create the missing settings window with JSON editors
Implement the modular panel system for resizable UI
