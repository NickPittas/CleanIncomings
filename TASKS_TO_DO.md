# Project Tasks and Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. WebSocket Functionality Removal (Objective from Checkpoint 7)
   - **Goal:** Systematically eliminate all traces of WebSocket functionality from the CleanIncomings application to resolve related errors and ensure stable operation.
   - **Actions Taken:**
     - **`fileops.py`:**
       - Removed references to `WEBSOCKET_AVAILABLE`.
       - Eliminated calls to `send_progress_update()` and its import.
       - Removed the `show_progress` argument from `__init__`.
     - **`scanner.py`:**
       - Removed references to `WEBSOCKET_AVAILABLE` and `get_websocket_port()`.
       - Deleted obsolete WebSocket-related comments.
       - Restored structural integrity of `scan_directory_with_progress` after accidental deletions.
       - Removed WebSocket-related logic from `get_scan_progress`.
     - **`start_progress_monitor.py`:**
       - Removed the assignment `WEBSOCKET_AVAILABLE = False`.
     - **Obsolete File Deletion:**
       - Confirmed `progress_server` module/files were not present.
       - Deleted `serve_progress_page.py` (was already missing prior to explicit deletion attempt).
       - Deleted `start_progress_monitor.py`.
       - Confirmed `static/progress_viewer.html` and the `static/` directory did not exist, validating the removal of associated server scripts.
     - **Verification:**
       - Performed `grep_search` across the `python/` directory to ensure no lingering references to `WEBSOCKET_AVAILABLE`, `get_websocket_port`, or `SERVER_STARTED` remained in `.py` files.

### 2. Bug Fix: `TypeError` in Profile Handling (`gui_normalizer_adapter.py`)
   - **Issue:** `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str` occurring when accessing `profile_data['name']`.
   - **Root Cause:** The `profiles.json` file stores profile configurations where each profile name maps to a *list* of rule dictionaries, but the adapter was expecting a single dictionary per profile.
   - **Actions Taken:**
     - Viewed `profiles.json` to understand its structure.
     - Modified `gui_normalizer_adapter.py` in the `scan_and_normalize_structure` method:
       - Updated logic to correctly retrieve the list of rule dictionaries for the given `profile_name`.
       - Implemented merging of this list of rule dictionaries into a single `profile_data` dictionary, specifically creating a unified `rules` key.
       - Ensured the `profile_data` dictionary includes essential keys like `name`, and placeholder defaults for `vfx_root` and `description` if not found during the merge.
       - This allows the subsequent code (including `MappingGenerator`) to work with the expected single-dictionary profile structure.

### 3. Enhanced Logging and Progress Reporting for Mapping Generation
   - **Goal:** Improve user feedback during the 'MAPPING GENERATION' phase by providing detailed progress updates.
   - **Actions Taken:**
     - Modified `mapping_utils/generate_mappings.py` to emit detailed status via a `status_callback` (e.g., files collected, sequences processed, single files mapped).
     - Propagated `status_callback` through `MappingGenerator` and `GuiNormalizerAdapter`.
     - Updated `GuiNormalizerAdapter.scan_and_normalize_structure` to correctly call `mapping_generator.generate_mappings` with the `status_callback` and process its results.
     - Enhanced `app_gui.py` (`_process_adapter_status`) to interpret new `mapping_generation` status messages and update the status label and progress bar accordingly (e.g., showing file counts like 'Processing sequence 10/50').

## Next Steps

### 1. Thorough Application Testing
   - **Objective:** Verify the application's stability and core functionality after WebSocket removal and the `TypeError` fix.
   - **Actions:**
     - Run `app_gui.py` and perform scans with various profiles (e.g., "Simple Project", "Sphere Project").
     - Check for any new runtime errors in the terminal output.
     - Verify that progress during scanning (file collection) is accurately reported.
     - **Specifically test the new detailed progress reporting for the 'MAPPING GENERATION' phase (e.g., progress of sequence processing, single file mapping) to ensure the status label and progress bar reflect these new updates.**
     - Confirm that file/folder normalization proposals are generated correctly based on selected profiles.
     - Test edge cases: empty directories, directories with many files, different file types.

### 2. Review `profiles.json` Structure (Long-term Consideration)
   - **Objective:** Ensure `profiles.json` has a consistent and maintainable structure.
   - **Consideration:** While the adapter now handles the list-based rule structure, evaluate if `profiles.json` should be refactored so each profile name maps to a *single* dictionary containing all its settings (including a unified `rules` dictionary and other metadata like `vfx_root`, `description`). This would align it better with `config_loader.py`'s likely expectations and simplify profile management overall.
     - This is a lower priority if the current fix in the adapter works reliably.

### 3. Code Cleanup and Refinement (Ongoing)
   - **Objective:** Maintain code quality and adherence to project rules.
   - **Actions:**
     - Review recently modified files for any further cleanup opportunities (e.g., unused imports, comments that need updating).
     - Ensure all changes adhere to `apprules.md`.
