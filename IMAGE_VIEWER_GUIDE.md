# Collapsible Image Viewer Guide

## Overview

The CleanIncomings application now includes a **Collapsible Image Viewer Panel** that displays the middle frame of image sequences directly within the application interface. This feature provides instant visual feedback when selecting sequences without launching external applications.

## Features

### üéØ Core Functionality
- **Collapsible Panel**: Starts collapsed by default, expandable with a single click
- **Embedded Image Display**: Shows images directly within the panel using Qt's native image handling
- **Automatic Middle Frame Detection**: Automatically finds and displays the middle frame of any selected image sequence
- **Smart Format Support**: Handles common formats natively, with fallback conversion for professional formats
- **Sequence Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the existing sequence detection and management system

### üé® User Interface
- **Right-Side Panel**: Positioned on the right side of the main application window
- **Toggle Button**: Click ‚ñ∂ to expand, ‚óÄ to collapse the panel
- **Image Controls**: Fit to window, actual size, and refresh controls
- **Status Display**: Shows sequence name, frame count, and current frame info
- **Scroll Support**: Large images can be scrolled within the display area

### üñºÔ∏è Image Format Support
- **Native Qt Formats**: JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF (basic), and other standard formats
- **Professional Formats**: EXR, HDR, DPX, CIN with fallback conversion using FFmpeg
- **Placeholder Display**: For unsupported formats, shows informative placeholder with filename
- **Smart Scaling**: Automatically scales images to fit the panel while maintaining aspect ratio

### ‚ö° Performance Features
- **Threaded Loading**: Images load in background threads to keep UI responsive
- **Memory Efficient**: Only loads one image at a time, with proper cleanup
- **Fast Preview**: Optimized for quick middle-frame preview rather than full sequence playback

## How to Use

### 1. **Expand the Panel**
- Look for the small ‚ñ∂ button on the right edge of the application
- Click it to expand the image viewer panel
- The panel will resize to show the image display area and controls

### 2. **Select a Sequence**
- Click on any image sequence in the main preview tree
- The viewer will automatically load and display the middle frame
- Sequence information (name, frame count) appears at the top

### 3. **View and Navigate**
- The middle frame appears directly in the panel
- Frame information shows: "Frame X/Y: filename.ext"
- Image dimensions are displayed below the frame info

### 4. **Image Controls**
- **üîÑ Refresh**: Reload the current image
- **‚äû Fit**: Scale image to fit the panel window
- **1:1**: Show image at actual pixel size (may require scrolling)

### 5. **Collapse When Done**
- Click the ‚óÄ button to collapse the panel back to minimal width
- This gives more space to the main preview area

## Technical Details

### Image Loading Process
1. **Sequence Selection**: When a sequence is selected, the middle frame index is calculated
2. **Background Loading**: Image loading happens in a separate thread to avoid UI blocking
3. **Format Detection**: Qt tries to load the image directly first
4. **Fallback Conversion**: For unsupported formats (like EXR), FFmpeg conversion is attempted
5. **Placeholder Generation**: If all else fails, an informative placeholder is shown
6. **Smart Scaling**: Images are scaled to fit the panel while preserving aspect ratio

### Supported Workflow
- **Standard Formats**: Immediate preview for JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and basic TIFF files
- **Professional Formats**: Conversion-based preview for EXR, HDR, DPX, CIN files (requires FFmpeg)
- **Unsupported Formats**: Informative placeholder with recommendation to use external viewers

### Memory Management
- **Single Image**: Only one image is loaded at a time to conserve memory
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Previous images are properly cleaned up when loading new ones
- **Thread Management**: Background threads are properly terminated when collapsing the panel

## Integration with External Players

The image viewer complements rather than replaces external media players:

- **Quick Preview**: Use the embedded viewer for instant visual feedback
- **Professional Review**: Right-click sequences to launch Nuke, MRV2, DJV, or other professional viewers
- **Full Sequence Playback**: Use external players for frame-by-frame navigation and full sequence review
- **Color-Critical Work**: Professional viewers provide better color management for critical work

## Settings and Configuration

### Panel Behavior
- **Default State**: Panel starts collapsed to maximize main window space
- **Width Control**: Preferred width is 450px when expanded, 30px when collapsed
- **Responsive Design**: Panel adapts to different window sizes and resolutions

### Image Loading
- **Max Preview Size**: Images are scaled to fit within the panel (typically 400x300 or larger)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Always preserved during scaling operations
- **Quality**: Uses Qt's SmoothTransformation for high-quality scaling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Image viewer shows "Preview not available"**
- A: This appears for formats that Qt cannot load natively (like EXR)
- Solution: Install FFmpeg for automatic conversion, or use external professional viewers

**Q: Images appear blurry or pixelated**
- A: This may occur with very large images scaled down to fit the panel
- Solution: Use the "1:1" button to view at actual size, or launch external viewers for full quality

**Q: Panel seems slow to load images**
- A: Loading happens in background threads; complex conversions may take time
- Solution: Standard formats (JPG, PNG) load instantly; professional formats may take a moment

**Q: EXR files don't show previews**
- A: EXR requires FFmpeg for conversion to displayable format
- Solution: Install FFmpeg, or right-click to use Nuke Player/MRV2 for native EXR viewing

### Performance Tips
- **Standard Formats**: Use JPG or PNG for fastest preview performance
- **Professional Workflows**: Use embedded viewer for quick checks, external viewers for detailed work
- **Large Sequences**: The viewer shows only the middle frame, keeping memory usage low

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently the image viewer operates through mouse interactions:
- **Click ‚ñ∂/‚óÄ**: Toggle panel expansion
- **Click Fit**: Fit image to panel
- **Click 1:1**: Show actual size
- **Click Refresh**: Reload current image

## Future Enhancements

Potential future features:
- Frame navigation (previous/next frame buttons)
- Zoom controls with mouse wheel
- Image information overlay (EXIF data, color space)
- Multiple format export options
- Thumbnail strip for sequence overview
