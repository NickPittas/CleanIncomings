## Features Implemented

### Visual Elements

1. **Stage Icons**: 
   - â—‹ Pending (gray)
   - ðŸ”„ In Progress (blue)
   - âœ“ Completed (green)  
   - âœ— Error (red)

2. **Progress Indicators**:
   - Individual progress bars for each stage
   - Overall progress bar showing total completion
   - Real-time details (file counts, current operations)
   - Color-coded status text

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Adapts to light/dark themes
   - Follows app's color scheme
   - Professional typography and spacing

### Functional Capabilities

1. **Stage Management**:
   - 5 distinct stages: Validation, Scanning, Mapping, Processing, Complete
   - Automatic stage transitions
   - Error handling at any stage
   - Progress tracking per stage

2. **Integration**:
   - Seamless integration with existing scan workflow
   - Thread-safe GUI updates
   - Backward compatibility with file operation progress
   - Automatic show/hide functionality

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Real-time file counts and folder processing
   - Current file/folder being processed
   - ETA estimation (where available)
   - Clear error messages with context

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
ScanManager (triggers) â†’ StatusManager (coordinates) â†’ ProgressPanel (displays)
     â†“                           â†“                              â†“
Validation Check â†’ start_scan_progress() â†’ show() + start_stage()
File Scanning â†’ _process_scan_stage_progress() â†’ update_stage_progress()
Mapping Gen â†’ _process_mapping_stage_progress() â†’ complete_stage()
Processing â†’ _process_transformation_stage_progress() â†’ complete_stage()
Completion â†’ finish_scan_progress() â†’ complete_stage() + auto-hide
```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Observer Pattern**: StatusManager coordinates between scan operations and UI updates
2. **State Machine**: ProgressPanel manages stage transitions and status
3. **Thread Safety**: All GUI updates properly scheduled on main thread
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has clear responsibilities

### API Design

```python
# Simple, intuitive API
progress_panel.start_stage('scanning', 'Starting scan...')
progress_panel.update_stage_progress('scanning', 0.5, '50 files processed')
progress_panel.complete_stage('scanning', 'Found 100 files')
progress_panel.error_stage('scanning', 'Permission denied')
```

## Benefits Achieved

### User Experience
- **Clear Feedback**: Users can see exactly what's happening at each stage
- **Professional Look**: Modern, polished interface that looks professional
- **Error Context**: Failed operations show clear error messages and context
- **Time Awareness**: Progress indicators help users understand remaining work

### Developer Experience
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for adding progress to any operation
- **Maintainable**: Centralized progress logic in dedicated components
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new stages or modify existing ones
- **Debuggable**: Clear logging and status tracking

### Code Quality
- **Modular Design**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Thread-Safe**: Proper handling of GUI updates from background threads
- **Consistent**: Standardized progress handling across the application
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- âœ… Stage transitions and visual updates
- âœ… Progress bar animations and timing
- âœ… Error handling and display
- âœ… Theme compatibility (light/dark modes)
- âœ… Thread safety and GUI updates

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Cancellation Support**: Add cancel buttons for long operations
2. **Nested Progress**: Show sub-stages within main stages
3. **Progress History**: Log of previous scan operations
4. **Sound Feedback**: Optional audio cues for completion/errors
5. **Better Estimation**: Time estimation based on file sizes and counts
6. **Animation**: Smooth transitions between stages

## Compliance

### Project Rules Adherence
- âœ… All files under 500 lines (largest is 312 lines)
- âœ… Single responsibility per module
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns
- âœ… Proper documentation and comments
- âœ… Thread-safe GUI operations

### Code Standards
- âœ… Type hints throughout
- âœ… Comprehensive docstrings
- âœ… Error handling at all levels
- âœ… Consistent naming conventions
- âœ… Modular, testable design

## Summary

The multi-stage progress panel enhancement successfully transforms the user experience during scanning operations from a basic progress indicator to a comprehensive, professional-grade progress display. The implementation maintains clean architecture principles while providing immediate user value through better visual feedback and error reporting.
