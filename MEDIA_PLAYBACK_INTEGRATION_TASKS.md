# Media Playback Integration Tasks

This document outlines the tasks re### 2.4. `python-vlc` Integration Logic
    - **Task:** Create a new Python class or set of functions (e.g., in `python/utils/vlc_player.py` or integrated into the GUI class) to manage the VLC player instance.
        - **Status: DONE** (`VLCPlayerWindow` class created)
    - **Task:** Implement error handling for VLC initialization, media loading, and playback issues. Display informative messages to the user.
        - **Status: DONE** (Comprehensive VLC error handling implemented, critical bugs fixed, and icon loading issues resolved)

### 2.5. VLC Interface Improvements
    - **Task:** Replace text buttons with actual media player icons (play, pause, stop, frame step)
        - **Status: COMPLETED** ✅ (Created and integrated media player icons: `media_play.png`, `media_pause.png`, `media_stop.png`, `media_step_backward.png`, `media_step_forward.png`)
    - **Task:** Center-align control buttons horizontally in the window
        - **Status: COMPLETED** ✅ (Redesigned controls layout with proper 4-button horizontal centering)
    - **Task:** Make the playback bar more visible and scrubable
        - **Status: COMPLETED** ✅ (Enhanced seek slider with custom colors, increased height to 20px, overlaid time labels)
    - **Task:** Prevent window from closing when video ends
        - **Status: COMPLETED** ✅ (Modified `_on_end_reached` to stop media instead of closing window)
    - **Task:** Add duration text and comprehensive media player information displays
        - **Status: COMPLETED** ✅ (Added media info panel showing filename, file size, FPS, and video resolution with proper formatting)
    - **Task:** Fix syntax errors and ensure module loads correctly
        - **Status: COMPLETED** ✅ (Fixed indentation issues and verified module imports successfully)
    - **Task:** Add zoom in/out functionality with scroll wheel and reset zoom button
        - **Status: COMPLETED** ✅ (Implemented mouse wheel zoom, keyboard shortcuts, reset zoom button with icon, and zoom level display in title bar)

### 2.6. Current Issue Resolution  
    - **Critical Bug:** The `_open_vlc_player_window` method in `widget_factory.py` has been corrupted with code from the `_apply_batch_changes` method
        - **Error:** `NameError: name 'items' is not defined` when trying to use VLC playback
        - **Root Cause:** Code contamination - batch editing logic mixed into VLC player method
        - **Solution:** Clean up `_open_vlc_player_window` method to contain only VLC player initialization logic
        - **Status: COMPLETED** ✅ (Bug fixed - method now contains only proper VLC player initialization logic)d to integrate media playback functionality into the application, offering two distinct methods:
1.  **External Playback using `ffplay`** (from FFmpeg) with a user-configurable path.
2.  **Embedded Playback using `python-vlc`** (libVLC bindings).

## Phase 1: External Playback with `ffplay`

### 1.1. User Settings for `ffplay` Path
    - **Task:** Modify `user_settings.json` to include a new key for the `ffplay` executable path.
        - Example: `"ffplay_path": ""`
        - **Status: DONE**
    - **Task:** Update settings loading logic (likely in `python/utils/settings_manager.py` or similar if it exists, otherwise in `app_gui.py`) to read this new setting.
        - **Status: DONE** (Handled in `app_gui.py` and `SettingsManager`)
    - **Task:** Implement a way for the user to set/update this path via the GUI (e.g., a new field in a settings dialog or a dedicated "Browse for ffplay" button).
        - **Status: DONE** (Part of the Settings window)

### 1.2. GUI Integration for `ffplay`
    - **Task:** Add a "Play with ffplay" button or context menu option to the file list/tree view in `app_gui.py`.
        - **Status: DONE** (Context menu option added in `widget_factory.py`)
    - **Task:** This UI element should be enabled only when a single media file is selected.
        - **Status: DONE** (Logic implemented in `_show_context_menu` in `widget_factory.py`)
    - **Task:** When activated, the UI element should call a new Python handler function, passing the absolute path of the selected media file.
        - **Status: DONE** (Calls `self.app.media_player_utils.launch_ffplay(p)` via `app_gui.play_with_ffplay_handler`)

### 1.3. `ffplay` Launch Logic
    - **Task:** Create a new Python utility function (e.g., in `python/utils/media_player.py` or similar) to handle launching `ffplay`.
        - **Status: DONE** (`MediaPlayerUtils` class in `python/utils/media_player.py` with `launch_ffplay` method)
        - This function will take the media file path as an argument.
        - It will retrieve the `ffplay_path` from the user settings.
    - **Task:** Use the `subprocess` module (e.g., `subprocess.Popen`) to launch `ffplay` with the media file path.
        - **Status: DONE** (Implemented in `MediaPlayerUtils.launch_ffplay`)
        - Ensure the command is constructed correctly for paths with spaces.
    - **Task:** Implement error handling:
        - **Status: DONE**
        - If `ffplay_path` is not set or is invalid, display an informative message to the user (e.g., "Please set the path to ffplay in settings."). (Handled in `app_gui.py`'s `play_with_ffplay_handler`)
        - Log any errors encountered during the launch process. (Basic logging/messaging in place)

### 1.4. Documentation & Testing
    - **Task:** Briefly document how to configure and use the `ffplay` feature for users.
        - **Status: PENDING**
    - **Task:** Test with various media file types and paths (including paths with spaces).
        - **Status: IN PROGRESS** (User is actively testing)
    - **Task:** Test error conditions (ffplay path not set, invalid path, non-playable file for ffplay).
        - **Status: IN PROGRESS** (User is actively testing)

### 1.5. FFplay Zoom Enhancement
    - **Task:** Enhance ffplay launch with zoom controls and better default window size
        - **Status: COMPLETED** ✅ (Enhanced ffplay command with default 800x600 window size and comprehensive zoom instructions)
    - **Task:** Provide user documentation for ffplay zoom controls
        - **Status: COMPLETED** ✅ (Console output displays all zoom and control shortcuts: Mouse wheel zoom, R for reset, F for fullscreen, click+drag for panning)

## Phase 2: Embedded Playback with `python-vlc` (More Complex)

*This phase is more involved and assumes a desire for playback within the application's window.*

### 2.1. Research & Dependency Management
    - **Task:** Confirm `python-vlc` installation requirements for development.
        - **Status: DONE** (User has confirmed installation)
    - **Task:** Decide on a strategy for `python-vlc` and libVLC dependencies for packaged/distributed versions of the application (e.g., bundling, user pre-installation).
        - **Status: IN PROGRESS** (`libvlc` directory included in workspace, `app_gui.py` attempts to configure paths)
        - If bundling, update build scripts (e.g., `.spec` file for PyInstaller) accordingly.
    - **Task:** Add `python-vlc` to project dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt` if used).
        - **Status: PENDING** (Assuming it's installed, but formal listing might be needed)

### 2.2. User Settings for libVLC (if not bundling or for overrides)
    - **Task (Optional):** Consider if a user-configurable path to libVLC installations is needed, similar to `ffplay_path`.
        - **Status: SKIPPED** (Currently relying on bundled/system path detection)

### 2.3. GUI Modifications for Embedded Player
    - **Task:** Design and implement a dedicated area/widget in the GUI (`app_gui.py`) where the video will be embedded.
        - **Status: DONE** (`VLCPlayerWindow` class, a `CTkToplevel`, created in `python/gui_components/vlc_player_window.py`)
    - **Task:** Add a "Play Embedded" button or context menu option, distinct from the `ffplay` option.
        - **Status: DONE** (Context menu option added in `widget_factory.py`)

### 2.4. `python-vlc` Integration Logic
    - **Task:** Create a new Python class or set of functions (e.g., in `python/utils/vlc_player.py` or integrated into the GUI class) to manage the VLC player instance.
        - **Status: DONE** (`VLCPlayerWindow` class created)
    - **Task:** Implement error handling for VLC initialization, media loading, and playback issues. Display informative messages to the user.
        - **Status: IN PROGRESS** (Basic error handling for module/class availability in `widget_factory.py` and `app_gui.py`. `_open_vlc_player_window` in `widget_factory.py` now correctly handles instance creation/focus. Further error handling within `VLCPlayerWindow` itself would be ongoing.)

### 2.5. Documentation & Testing
    - **Task:** Document how to use the embedded player and any prerequisites (like libVLC installation if not bundled).
        - **Status: PENDING**
    - **Task:** Test on different target operating systems if applicable.
        - **Status: IN PROGRESS** (User is actively testing on Windows)
