# GuiNormalizerAdapter: Insights, Testing, and Review Areas

This document summarizes key understandings of the `GuiNormalizerAdapter` component, suggests manual test scenarios for the application, and highlights potential areas for code review and enhancement based on recent unit testing efforts.

## 1. Learnings from `GuiNormalizerAdapter` and its Tests

The process of refactoring and fixing the unit tests for `GuiNormalizerAdapter` has provided significant insights into a core part of the application:

### 1.1. Application Structure & Workflow:
*   The `GuiNormalizerAdapter` is central to the normalization process. It takes user inputs (source path, destination, profile choice) and orchestrates the work of two other key components:
    *   `FileSystemScanner`: This module scans the specified directory. It works asynchronously (in a separate thread) and provides progress updates.
    *   `MappingGenerator`: This module takes the file structure from the scanner and the rules from a selected user profile, then figures out the proposed new names and paths.
*   **Configuration is key:**
    *   `profiles.json`: Stores different sets of rules (profiles) that users can define and choose. Each profile includes its name, the actual rules (or a path to a `rules_file`), and potentially other metadata like a `vfx_root`.
    *   `patterns.json`: Stores common regex patterns that the `MappingGenerator` uses across different profiles.

### 1.2. How It Works & Communication:
*   The main workflow in `scan_and_normalize_structure` is: Scan -> Generate Mappings -> Transform Mappings for UI.
*   **Status Updates:** A `status_callback` function is passed through these layers. This is crucial for the GUI to provide feedback to the user, including:
    *   Scan progress (e.g., "Scanned 50 files...").
    *   Mapping generation status (starting, completed).
    *   Proposal transformation status (starting, completed).
    These updates are dictionaries with a `type` (scan, mapping_generation, transformation) and `data` (status, message).
*   **Data Flow:**
    *   Scanner produces a file/folder `tree`.
    *   This `tree` and a processed `profile_object_for_generator` (containing name and rules) go into `MappingGenerator`.
    *   `MappingGenerator` outputs raw proposals.
    *   `GuiNormalizerAdapter` then refines these proposals into a more structured format suitable for display in a GUI table (including IDs, original/new paths, normalized parts, tags, etc.).

## 2. Manual Test Scenarios for the Application

It's recommended to run through these scenarios in your application to cover common use cases and potential edge cases for the normalization feature:

1.  **Basic Happy Path:**
    *   **Setup:** A few files in a simple folder structure that clearly match rules in one of your basic profiles.
    *   **Action:** Select the source, destination, and the relevant profile. Run the scan and normalize.
    *   **Verify:** Correct proposals are shown; status messages in the UI are accurate and timely; applying proposals correctly moves/renames files.
2.  **Profile with Specific/Complex Rules:**
    *   **Setup:** Files that test more complex rules in a profile (e.g., rules from a `rules_file`, multiple pattern matches, exclusions if supported). Include some files that *should not* match.
    *   **Action:** Run scan and normalize with this profile.
    *   **Verify:** Correct proposals for matching files; non-matching files are handled appropriately.
3.  **Empty Source Directory:**
    *   **Action:** Attempt to scan an empty directory.
    *   **Verify:** The application handles this gracefully (e.g., "No files found" message, no errors).
4.  **Large Number of Files/Deeply Nested Structure:**
    *   **Setup:** A directory with many files and subfolders.
    *   **Action:** Scan and normalize.
    *   **Verify:** Performance is acceptable; scan progress updates are meaningful; application remains responsive.
5.  **Files with No Matching Rules:**
    *   **Setup:** A directory of files that do not match any rules in the selected profile.
    *   **Action:** Scan and normalize.
    *   **Verify:** No proposals are generated, or items are marked as "unmatched." UI clearly indicates this.
6.  **Special Characters or Long Filenames:**
    *   **Setup:** Files with names containing spaces, special characters (if OS/rules allow), or very long paths/names.
    *   **Action:** Scan and normalize.
    *   **Verify:** These are handled correctly without errors, and proposals are valid.

## 3. Potential Areas for Review in `GuiNormalizerAdapter` (and related logic)

While the unit tests for `GuiNormalizerAdapter` are now passing, consider these points for further robustness:

1.  **Error Handling in Transformation Loop:**
    *   **Context:** In `scan_and_normalize_structure`, when looping through `proposals` from `MappingGenerator` to transform them for the GUI, if a proposal item (`p_item`) has an unexpected structure, `.get()` methods might return `None`, potentially leading to subtle issues.
    *   **Suggestion:** Consider more robust error checking *per item* within that loop. For example, logging a warning or marking an individual proposal as "failed to transform" if it's malformed.
2.  **Scan Cancellation:**
    *   **Context:** The current `scan_and_normalize_structure` doesn't appear to have an explicit mechanism to request the scan thread to stop prematurely if a user initiates a cancel action from the GUI.
    *   **Suggestion:** If scan cancellation is desired, the `FileSystemScanner.scan_directory_with_progress` method would need to periodically check a cancellation flag, and `GuiNormalizerAdapter` would need a way to set this flag.
3.  **Resource Intensive Operations:**
    *   **Context:** Scanning very large file systems and then generating/transforming mappings for thousands of items could be resource-intensive.
    *   **Suggestion:** Monitor performance with large datasets. The current asynchronous scanning is good. If mapping and transformation become bottlenecks, further optimization or threading (with care for Python's GIL) might be considered.
