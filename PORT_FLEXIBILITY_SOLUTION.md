# Port Flexibility Solution

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where Electron couldn't connect to Vite when ports changed due to conflicts. Now both Vite and Electron automatically adapt to available ports.

## 🔧 Solution Overview

### 1. **Dynamic Port Detection**
- Vite automatically finds available ports (3001, 3002, 3003, etc.)
- Writes actual port to `.vite-port` file when server starts
- Electron reads this file to connect to the correct port

### 2. **Automatic Port File Creation**
```json
{
  "port": 3001,
  "timestamp": 1748349007707,
  "url": "http://localhost:3001",
  "pid": 35676
}
```

### 3. **Fallback System**
- If port file missing, Electron tries common ports (3001-3005)
- Multiple fallback strategies ensure connection

## 📁 Files Modified

### `vite.config.ts`
- Added `write-port` plugin
- Hooks into server.listen() to write port file
- Added `/__port` endpoint for runtime port queries
- Set `strictPort: false` for auto-increment

### `electron/main.ts`
- Enhanced port detection logic
- Reads `.vite-port` file first
- Falls back to port scanning if file missing
- Uses Node.js http module for port testing

### `.gitignore`
- Added `.vite-port` to ignore list
- Prevents committing runtime files

## 🧪 Testing

### Port Conflict Test
```bash
node test-port-conflict.js
```
Results:
- ✅ System detects port conflicts
- ✅ Vite auto-increments to available port
- ✅ Electron reads actual port from file
- ✅ No manual configuration needed

### Port Endpoint Test
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/__port
```
Returns: `{"port":3001,"url":"http://localhost:3001"}`

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Zero Configuration**: No manual port management needed
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically handles port conflicts
3. **Multiple Terminals**: Each terminal gets its own port
4. **Reliable Connection**: Electron always connects to correct Vite server
5. **Development Friendly**: Works seamlessly with multiple dev instances

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Vite Startup**:
   - Tries port 3001, auto-increments if busy
   - Writes actual port to `.vite-port` file
   - Provides `/__port` endpoint for queries

2. **Electron Startup**:
   - Reads `.vite-port` file for current port
   - Falls back to port scanning if file missing
   - Connects to detected Vite server

3. **Runtime**:
   - Both systems stay synchronized
   - Port changes are automatically handled
   - No manual intervention required

## 📋 Usage

Simply run the development server as usual:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The system automatically:
- Finds available ports
- Creates port communication file
- Connects Electron to Vite
- Handles all port conflicts

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If connection issues occur:
1. Check if `.vite-port` file exists
2. Verify Vite server is running: `netstat -an | findstr ":300"`
3. Test port endpoint: `curl http://localhost:PORT/__port`
4. Check Electron logs for connection attempts

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

The port flexibility system is fully implemented and tested. Both Vite and Electron now automatically adapt to available ports, eliminating manual port management and connection issues.
